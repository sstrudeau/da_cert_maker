Simple script to generate a PDF "certificates" in bulk from a list of CSVs for a limited use case as a favor to a friend.

The script requires JRuby, a PDF form file (with a single text form field labeled 'name') and a CSV file containing names to put on the certificates (no header, names in the first column).
